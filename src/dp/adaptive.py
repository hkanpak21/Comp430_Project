# This file is intended to hold the logic for adaptive DP mechanisms.
# Implementing these requires careful handling of state (e.g., historical grads),
# adjusting DP parameters (noise, clipping) within the training loop, and potentially
# custom optimizer steps or hooks.

# --- AWDP (Adaptive Weight-Based DP - Complex) --- #

# Implementing AWDP (electronics-13-03959-v2.pdf) requires:
# 1. Storing historical gradients (potentially per layer).
# 2. Calculating gradient similarity/importance.
# 3. Computing weights for clipping based on history and importance.
# 4. Applying potentially layer-wise clipping norms based on these weights.
# This likely involves significant modifications to the optimizer or training loop.

def apply_awdp(model, optimizer, history_buffer, args):
    """Placeholder for the complex AWDP logic."""
    logging.warning("AWDP logic not implemented.")
    # Conceptual steps:
    # 1. Access current gradients (per-sample if possible, or averaged).
    # 2. Compare with historical gradients in history_buffer.
    # 3. Calculate importance weights (e.g., based on variance, magnitude, similarity).
    # 4. Calculate adaptive clipping norms (potentially layer-wise) based on weights.
    # 5. Manually clip gradients using the calculated norms.
    # 6. Add noise (potentially adaptive noise as well).
    # 7. Update history buffer.

# --- Priority-Based Adaptive DP (Weights) --- # 

# Implementing Priority-Based (2401.02453v1.pdf) involves:
# 1. Identifying important features/weights (e.g., using magnitude, Fisher info).
# 2. Applying noise preferentially to less important weights.
# This typically modifies the noise addition step, not necessarily clipping.

def apply_priority_noise(model, noise_multiplier, importance_metric):
    """Placeholder for priority-based noise addition."""
    logging.warning("Priority-based noise logic not implemented.")
    # Conceptual steps:
    # 1. Calculate importance score for each parameter/weight.
    # 2. Generate noise scaled by the inverse of importance (less important -> more noise).
    # 3. Add scaled noise to parameters.
